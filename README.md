# WulfilaVerse

A Userscript which adds Wulfila.be verse links to Bible Hub and Bible Gateway,
but only if attested. Useful for finding words and phrases on Bible Hub and Bible Gateway,
immediately seeing if a verse is attested in Gothic and being presented
with a Wulfila.be link when it is.
The script also links to both BibleHub and Bible Gateway from Wulfila.be.

## Examples

Bible Hub's search looks through many different Bible English translations
which helps finding phrases and grammar in Gothic.
You can even put quotes around multiple words to keep them together.<br />
