# WulfilaVerse

A Userscript which adds Wulfila.be verse links to BibleHub and BibleGateway,
but only if attested. Useful for finding phrases or Greek words in BibleHub,
immediately seeing if a verse is attested in Gothic and being presented
with a Wulfila.be link when it is.
The script also links to both BibleHub and Bible Gateway from Wulfila.be.

Bible Hub's search looks through many different Bible English translations
which helps finding phrases and grammar in Gothic.
You can even put quotes around multiple words to keep them together.
